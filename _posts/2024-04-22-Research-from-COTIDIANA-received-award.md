Nasim Nakhost Lotfi,  PhD student at the Medical University of Vienna, presented the results of the VADIPRO study during the Digital Rheumatology Days in March 2024. The study shed light on reliability and convergent validity of digitally collected PROMs through the COTIDIANA app.

The implementation of PROs collected through digital devices relies on data, how to reliable interpret courses and deviations beyond measurement error of patients in domains like health-related quality of life or disease specific outcomes. The Digital Rheumatology days are a great forum to discuss innovations in novel opportunities to care and manage people with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases. 

Thus we are very happy to share that Nasim Nakhost Lotfi has won the poster prize in this yearâ€™s Digital Rheumatology Days.
