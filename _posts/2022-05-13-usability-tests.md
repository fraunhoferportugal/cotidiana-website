The last weeks were marked by usability tests with end-users. As a high fidelity prototype of the app was available, AICOS was able to test it with end-users in Porto, Portugal. The focus of the test was finding usability issues and gather end-users' perspectives about the app. Patients mentioned the relevance of the app, especially when the condition was not controlled. In terms of usability, the app faired well, and the consortium is eager to test it in the field trials in some months.
