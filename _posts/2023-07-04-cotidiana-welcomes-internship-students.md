During their one-month internship at AICOS, two students delved into the smartphone data collected from patients involved in laboratory data collections for the COTIDIANA project. Focused on understanding smartphone-based metrics, the interns explored and analyzed keyboard dynamics data from individuals with rheumatic conditions (Osteoarthritis, Rheumatoid Arthritis, and Psoriatic Arthritis).

Their work contributed to the development of algorithms within the COTIDIANA solution. This effort underscores the project's commitment to enabling efficient patient monitoring for clinical care using mobile applications. The students established remarkable relationships between keyboard typing speed (e.g., key pressing time, words/minute) and performance (error rates), providing valuable insights for enhancing the efficacy of the COTIDIANA solution.

Definitely a valuable experience our team wants to repeat.
