The development of COTIDIANA has finished and we started the validation of the system with end-users. The trials in Lisbon are focused on assessing the usability of the system, as well as understanding the potential of passive sensing modules in capturing the condition state of patients with Knee or Hip Osteoarthritis. The feasibility pilot will run for three months, in three different hospitals: CHULC - Hospital Santo António dos Capuchos, Hospital Lusíadas, and CHLO - Hospital de Egas Moniz.

<!--If you live in Portugal and have Knee or Hip Osteoarthritis, you may be able to participate in the trials. Contact us.-->
