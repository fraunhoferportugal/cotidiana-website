AICOS and CHRC have started data collections with patients in Lisbon. To support the development of the system, COTIDIANA is inviting people with rheumatic conditions to walk brief distances with a smartphone in the pocket, write some sentences in a smartphone, share their communication logs anonymously, and fill-in some questionnaires in an app and in paper. The data collected will support the development of algorithms that assess the condition state of the patient passively. 

If you live in Portugal and have Osteoarthritis, Rheumatoid Arthritis, and Psoriatic Arthritis, you may be able to participate in these sessions. Contact us.
